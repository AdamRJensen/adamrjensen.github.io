# About me

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at the Technical University of Denmark, working on modeling and assessing solar energy systems and the solar resource.

I work on a broad spectrum of projects, including characterizing concentrated solar collectors, optimizing solar hybrid power plant, and quality control of solar resource data.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention that I am also the station manager for the solar radiation measurement station in Copenhagen. The station is one of two places in Denmark where all three irradiance components are measured and the data is freely accessible at our [website](http://climatestationdata.byg.dtu.dk/).
