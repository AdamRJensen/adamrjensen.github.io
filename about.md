# About me

I recently completed my PhD and will be starting postdoctoral work soon. My work so far has focused on the impact of the solar spectrum on photovoltaic device performance.

One of the primary motivations for writing this blog is to share updates on and my experience of implementing new spectral correction functions in [pvlib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/) as part of my [Google Summer of Code project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
