# About me

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at the Technical University of Denmark, working on modeling and assessing solar energy systems and solar resource assessment.

I work on a lot of different projects, including characterizing concentrated solar collectors, solar hybrid power plant modeling, and quality control of solar resource data.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention that I am also the station manager for the solar radiation measurement station in Copenhagen. The station is one of two places that all three irradiance components are measured in Denmark and all of the data is freely accessible at our [website](http://climatestationdata.byg.dtu.dk/).
