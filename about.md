# About me

Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), working on modeling and assessment of solar energy systems and the solar resource.

I work on a broad spectrum of projects, including characterization of concentrated solar collectors, optimization of solar hybrid power plants, and quality control of solar resource data.

Additionally, I am also the station manager for the solar radiation measurement station in Copenhagen. The station is one of two places in Denmark where all three irradiance components are measured and the data is freely accessible on our [website](http://climatestationdata.byg.dtu.dk/).
