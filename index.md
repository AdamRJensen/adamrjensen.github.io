# Adam R. Jensen - About Me

Great to see that you have stumbled upon my blog!

I'm a research scientist at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), working on modeling and assessment of solar energy systems and the solar resource.

On this blog, I'll share some of the many interesting things I work on, including tips and tricks to working with solar resource data in Python.
