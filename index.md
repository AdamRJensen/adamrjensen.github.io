# Adam R. Jensen - About Me

Great to see that you have stumbled upon my blog!

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Technical University of Denmark, working on modeling and assessing solar energy systems and the solar resource.

On this blog I'll share some of the many interesting things I work on, including tips and tricks to working with solar resource data in Python.
