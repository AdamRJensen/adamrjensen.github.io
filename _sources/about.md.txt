# About me

Iâ€™m a research scientist at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), working on modeling and assessment of solar energy systems and the solar resource.

I work on a broad spectrum of projects, including solar resource assessment (model development, quality control, and validation), PV performance modeling, and testing of solar energy systems.

Additionally, I am also the station manager for the solar radiation measurement station in Copenhagen. The station is one of two places in Denmark where all three irradiance components are measured.
