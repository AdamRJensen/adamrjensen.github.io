## Comment section
The comment section is enable using the [disqus service](https://disqus.com/). Besides registrering for a free account, the only thing necessary to make it run with ablog is to set the disqus_shortname and blog_baseurl in the conf.py file. Your disqus shortname is a unique identifier for your specific website, which you can find in the admin section of your disqus account.

By default only posts will have the comment section, but it is possible to [enable](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/ablog-configuration-options/#disqus-integration) all sections to have it.
