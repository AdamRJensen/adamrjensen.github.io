# International Pyrheliometer Comparison

It's essential that we agree what 1 W/m2 is, but it's not as simple as you may think! Since, 1977 the definition has bee


The Internatioal Pyrheliometer Comparison (IPC) takes palace every 5 years at the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos/World Radiation Centre (PMOD/WRC) in Davos, Switzerland.

> The regularity of IPCs is a key to traceability of solar radiation measurements around the world using the WRR, and this report summarizes the outcomes of the 12th IPC. The report demonstrates the stability of the WRR in providing a world-wide metrological reference.

> However, comparisons held over the last decade, and particularly since IPC-XI, have indicated that there may be a 0.3% bias between the International System of Units (SI) and WRR.

> The last significant change in the historical record was done with the introduction of the WRR on 1 January 1980 as the measurement reference for solar exposure and irradiance data records.

## Pyrgeometer and photometer comparison?
Concurrently, with the pyrheliometer comparisons, the International Pyrgeometer Comparisons (IPgC) and X takes place.
